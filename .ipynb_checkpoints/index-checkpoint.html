							<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing the impact, in terms of health, both mental and physical, 
								of governmental programs designed to improve the well-being of their citizens is key in order to 
								enhance the policy-making perspective in such programs. In developing countries, where the 
								percentage of the population living in extreme poverty is great, these programs become a matter 
								of national priority.</p>

								<h2>The <strong>Piso Firme</strong> program</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">Piso Firme (or "firm floor" in English) is a large scale Mexican program
							which aimed to propose to households to replace their dirt floors by cement floors for free. Families were proposed
							up to 50 square meters of concrete cement floors of a value of about 1,500 Mexican pesos, which was aproximately
							150 dollars. On the map below, one can see that dirt floors are numerous in the twin cities of Gómez Palacios and Torreón
							(which will be the regions of interest for the study). Some clusters of household have more than 75% of dirt floors.
							In total, 10% of the households in the observed region live with floors made of dirt.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">In the paper "Housing, Health, and Happiness" by Cataneo, M. 
								et. al. (2009),  the health impacts of the Piso Firme program are analyzed and assessed.  
								The aim of this study was to measure the impact on the health of young children, and the 
								feeling of happiness of their caretakers (usually their mothers) by that program. Measurements 
								for the incidence of parasitic infestations, diarrhea, cognitive development, and anemia in 
								children, and measurements in increased satisfaction with their household and quality of life, 
								depression and stress scales in the adults were used to perform several regression analyses 
								to determine whether or not the program has a significant impact in such factors.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								One of the results from this paper is the observation of significant positive effects on maternal 
								happiness in households that were proposed Piso Firme, such as a decrease of perceived stress and depression, and an increase 
								in house satisfaction and quality of life.

								<h2>Are adults happier when they invest in installation of cement floors ?</h2>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that Piso Firme improves the well-being of caretakers in these
								households by installing cement floors. A maximum number of people should benefit from it. Why
								doesn't the government create campaigns to promote installation of cement floors in households ?
								This could be a very cost-effective action to improve general well-being in the region of interest
								as households would invest themselves in their housing to (hopefully) observe these benefits. 
								But these households have limited economic ressources. Therefore, if we want to advise households
								on what improvement they should invest in, we need to make
								sure that households who invested by themselves in cement floors received similar benefits as
								households who were proposed Piso Firme. Thus, we will try to determine if households that
								decided to install cement floors without aid from the government also show the same mental
								health and satisfaction improvements.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify;">To measure mental health we consider 5 variables :
									<ul style="text-align: left;">
										<li>The satisfaction with floor quality</li>
										<li>The satisfaction with house quality</li>
										<li>The satisfaction with quality of life</li>
										<li>The score on the depression Scale (CES-D Scale)</li>
										<li>The score on the perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</li>
									</ul>
								</p>								

							<p style="text-align: justify;">We consider now the households that were not proposed the Piso Firme program and we define two groups: those who installed cement floors and those who didn't. But before going further, let's check the mean income of the two groups. The chart is abailable below.</p>

							<!-- Mean income before matching -->

								<div class="col-12 col-12-narrower">
									<section>
											<iframe src="figures/income_before_matching.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
									</section>
								</div>
							</div>
							
							<p style="text-align: justify;">It looks like people who installed cement floors in their households have higher incomes (which is expected). This is bad news, it could bias the results. To solve this problem, the considered households will be balanced using a matching algorithm on the income per capita of households.
							This way, samples with similar incomes will be considered ! Below you can find the mean income per capita in the two groups after matching.</p>


							<!-- Mean income after matching -->
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-12 col-12-narrower">
									<section>
											<iframe src="figures/income_after_matching.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
									</section>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">Groups are balanced now. We can perform the regression analysis. Let's look how the installation of cement floors impact the happiness/satisfaction variables !</p>

							<!-- RQ 1 results -->
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-12 col-12-narrower">
									<section>
											<iframe src="" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
									</section>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">The figure above shows that the installation of cement floor does improve floor 
								satisfaction of about 11% (with a 10% significance level), but there is no strong evidence saying it 
								increases the house and life satisfaction significantly in other variables. More research would 
								need to be done on this side. Also the stress level doesn't seem to get lower, maybe because 
								households need to spend a part of their revenue for it, creating potential economic concerns in 
								those households. To increase happiness, advising households to invest in cement floors is not 
								sufficient, governmental programs such as Piso Firme seem to be necessary for the well-being of 
								these households.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">But the budget of such programmes are limited. Therefore in the next research question,
							we will search how to make the program more cost-efficient. One way to make Piso Firme less costly is to install less
							cement. Terefore, we will try to install less cement in households, but in a more efficient way ! This is how we proceed :
							we consider 4 rooms the kitchen, the dinning room, the bathrooms, and bedrooms. The used data set indicates in what rooms
							cement floors were installed. Therefore, another regression analysis on the satisfaction indicators can help us to
							understand what are the most important rooms where cement floors should be installed. This way, Piso Firme (or a similar
							program) can be optimized to allow a greater number of people to benefit from it !</p>

							<header class="major">
								<h2>What we learned</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
							We found a significant increase of 11% in the satisfaction of floor quality in the households who invested in cement floors.
							But no significant result was found concerning the impact of investment in cement floors for households on the 
							satisfaction with house quality, quality of life, depression and perceived stress. More data would need to be
							collected to find more. But even tho satisfaction with the quality of floor increases significantly, the government
							should focus on providing financial aids such as Piso Firme to households as they showed stronger and more significant
							results. Furthermore, the households who need improvement of their quality of life the most are the ones 
							who cannot afford an installation of cement floors.
